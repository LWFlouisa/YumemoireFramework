==============

1. French becomes a temporary care giver for what remains of the US government,
rather than a hard military take over. French became increasingly normalized and
became a de facto Lingua Franca replacing English.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* French reimplemented the national razor as the new default method of capital
punishment.
  - During the Franco-Japanese Wars, this began to take on the form of a Shinto
tower as the last form of disrespect to the condemned.
  - It eventually became illegal openly practice the Shinto religion, with them
having to pretend to be Catholics.


* People that come from mixed backgrounds such as half French people of Japanese
descent are sometimes confused for Spanish speakers, and thus experience similar
forms of descrimination.

* French animation began to be taught in American animation departments in
universites and game design studios.

* A subset of the first known vampire, evolved into "Homo Vampiris" from which
genes were spliced, and creating a new race of Vampire-men that live at night,
and feast on blood.


2. Japan took over territories that onced belonged to the US in the Pacific Ocean,
which later became part of California and the Japanese Pacific states, Here
Japanese imperialism 2.0 went into full force. With Japanese religious monuments
built.

* Initially Japan used hanging as the default means of capital punishment, but
later switched to the German model of the guillotine.
  - Hanging was originally meant as a standardization when moving away from
beheading by Katana during World War II.
  - Many prison practices are are hold over from the early days of Japanese
imperialism.


* Japanese citizens descended from white Californians suffer descriminations, and
persecution for their Catholic religion, straining relationships with their
French cousins across the Rocky Mountains.
  - In particular it became harder to date Ethno-Japanese, and thus families had to
smuggle their half-children in order to secure a proper education. Some of these
ending up dating members of the vampire race as mutual outcasts, forming a new
subset of the Vampire race.
  - Japanese vampire evolved to have distinct characteristics from French vampires
over the new few decades and centuries.


* A rogue French animator who had worked as a military scientist, fled with his
Japanese girlfriend, and are protected by a small group of bodyguards against
the French imperialist military. Down to the last guard, the two survived and
established a Franco-Japanese Animation School in California.
  - This began the slow evolution of a seperate branch of Japanese manga and
animation that took more inspiration from French comics, rather than American
comics, developing a distinct identity from mainland Manga.
  - These types of manga developed distinct printing practices that differ from
monochromatic printing, and more reflecting of the color scheme of Bande
Dessinee, and often were bilingual in Japanese and Francais.


3. Franco-Japanese Wars
-----------------------

* The first few inciting instances evolved from the political anxieities of wars
against Mexico and Canada, with the French becoming proficient with treating
conflicts like border disputes.

* The last stand that protected a French and Japanese animation became natorious
as a blunder during France's new era of imperialism.

* As a compromise to end conflicts, it was agreed that Japanese would be a second
language in French schools, and French as a secondary language. And reverting
the national razor back to the French model, with some refined improvements.


4. Hybrid Mythology
-------------------

* Aspects of Quebecous and Japanese folklore began to merge with vampire myths,
contributed to rumors and speculations about werebears, with the first known
Kumabatto dating back to before Uploaded Fairy. Such creatures while dangerous,
could be appeased by offering them protection while having revenge against the
bear-men that killed them in battle.
